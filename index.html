                            <p> What is Karate? For me,karate, an unarmed martial arts discipline employing kicking, striking, and defensive blocking with arms and legs. Emphasis is on concentrating as much of the body's power as possible at the point and instant of impact. I started Karate at a very young age. I supposedly enrolled in Taekwondo, but with the conflict of schedules of my working mother, I didnâ€™t pursue Taekwondo. Instead, I enrolled in karate in the weekend classes of Sense David Lay and Sensei Maricar; both sensei are well-known and respected in the sports associations here and overseas. These two Sensei molded me into where I am now, and I have no fear of competing here and abroad. </p>
